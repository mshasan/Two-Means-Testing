# Two-Means_Testing
A test for equality of two normal means when the data consist of both paired and unpaired observations is proposed. The proposed test is compared with two other standard methods known in the literature with respect to the type I error rate and power using simulation results.

This repository contains simulation results and the corresponding SAS codes. To conduct the simulations we considered that the samples are from different distributions, and their population varainces are either equal or unequal.
